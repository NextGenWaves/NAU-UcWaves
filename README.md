# üß¨ North American Union @ucwaves Ecosystem

This repository contains the core smart contracts for the **North American Union @ucwaves Ecosystem** ‚Äî a decentralized opinion-sharing mechanism built on [Base](https://base.org/). It includes three ERC-20 tokens: `NAU`, `NAUY`, and `NAUN`, and a `Controller` contract for minting and burning logic. It also includes a **Developer Vesting** contract and a **Staking contract** with three deployed instances:

- **NAU Staking**
- **NAUY Staking**
- **NAUN Staking**

We also created 3 UniswapV3 Liquidity Pools on Base:

- **NAU/USDC LP**
- **NAUY/USDC LP**
- **NAUN/USDC LP**
